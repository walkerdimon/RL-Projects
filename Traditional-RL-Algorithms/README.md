# What is Included
Found here is a repository of traditional RL algorithms developed and tested on two environments, a simple gridworld and discrete pendulum. The RL algorithms developed for this project include Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, SARSA, and Q-Learning.  From Reinforcement Learning Course taught at The University of Illinois, Fall 2020


## TO RUN CODE:    
all algorithms can be found in 'algorithms.py'. Each environment and algorithm is activated by the argument command '--'.  
To run a given algorithm, type 'run.py' in the command followed by the desired environment and algorithm argument.
For example, 'run.py --gridworld --value_iteration' will run the value iteration algorithm for the gridworld environment.
Through running this algorithm, all data needed for the deliverable visualizations is stored as a pickle, which can then be accessed in the 'plot.py' file.
